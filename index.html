                <h2>How to plan for Natural Disaster</h2>
                <p>Practice evacuating your home twice a year. Grab your emergency kit, just like you will in a real
                    emergency, then drive your planned evacuation route. Plot alternate routes on your map in case roads
                    are impassable. Make sure you have locations and maps saved on devices such as cell phones and GPS
                    units and on paper.
                    Plan ahead for your pets. Keep a phone list of pet-friendly hotels/motels and animal shelters that
                    are along your evacuation routes. Remember, if it’s not safe for you to stay home, it’s not safe for
                    your pets either.. ....</p>

                            families, and individuals should know what to do in the event of a fire and where to seek
                            shelter during a powerful storm. They should be ready to evacuate their homes and take
                            refuge in public shelters and know how to care for their basic medical needs.</p>

                <h2>How can We help?</h2>
                <p>Many groups are set up to help people during a disaster. The best thing you can do is to support them. They know what is needed for each situation. They can guide you on how to give. Visit their websites to find out what they need.</p>
                <p>Here are some of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a  href="https://www.rescue.org/" target="_blank">International Rescue Committee</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/" target="_blank">UNICEF</a></li>
                    <!-- <li><a href="https://www.redcross.org/ " target="_blank">American Red Cross</a></li> -->
                </ul>
                <p>It's OK if your family doesn't have a lot to give. Every donation, big or small, helps to rebuild when communities are hit by disasters.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>What Can We Give?</h2>
                <p>Giving money always helps. But it’s not the only thing families can do. Here are other ways that you and your kids can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Donate food or other items. </b>Check with your local Red Cross chapter, community center (like the YMCA), or place of worship to find out what they need. Sometimes, charities get too many donations and have to spend money storing or handling the extra items. So ask what’s needed before you give.</li>
                    <br><li><b>Donate your time. </b>Offer to help sort through donations or deliver goods to families affected by the disaster.</li>
                    <br><li><b>Organize a fundraiser. </b>Start a drive to collect money or supplies for disaster victims. Or plan a walk, run, bake sale, or other activity to raise money. A good place to do it is through your place of worship or your kids’ school.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h2>Why It Matters? </h2>
                <p>Volunteering your time, money, or efforts can help your community — and others — in a time of need. It’s also a way to teach your kids to value giving. Times you spend helping others, especially as a family, are times kids will always remember. It’s meaningful and helps you feel close.</p>
                <p>Giving and helping deepen positive emotions like compassion and gratitude. These emotions feel good. And they do us good too. They build coping skills, lower our stress response, and support our mental well-being. And that’s good for everyone.</p>
